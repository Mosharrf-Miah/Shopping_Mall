# Shopping-Mall-Analysis 

## Description
In this project I explored a dataset based on the activities of shopping malls within Istanbul, Turkey. I was able to analyse each individual shopping mall, finding the top 5 shopping malls, the average price of different product types and if there is a seasonal change in how much money each shopping mall makes. The project also allowed me to delve deeper in the spending habits between both gender and age range, allowing me to identify average spend and popular products between the genders, the most sold product based on age range as well as the average price spend by each age range.

# Shopping mall SQL analysis

## Description
This project involved exploring a dataset that captured the activities of shopping malls in Istanbul, Turkey. I analysed each shopping mall individually and identified the top five performers, the average prices of different product categories, and the seasonal variations in their revenues.  The dataset allowed me to delve deeper and examine the spending patterns of customers based on their gender and age group. I discovered the average amount and the most popular products for each gender, the best-selling product for each age group, and the average price paid by each age group.
